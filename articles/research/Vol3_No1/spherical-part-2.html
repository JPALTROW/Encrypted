I use terminology in this article that I defined in that article, so I recommend you read that article first.<h1 class=unnumbered id=narrowing-down-the-spiral-methods>Narrowing Down the Spiral Methods</h1><p>In Part <span class="inline math">\(1\)</span>, I tested three spiral methods, the Double Spiral Method, the Single Spiral Method, and the Modified Single Spiral Method, on each spherical fullerene. However, this is not necessary.<p>The Double Spiral Method and Single Spiral method are very similar, except in the Double Spiral method you have to keep track of two spirals, while in the Single Spiral method you only have to keep track of one. This means there are more potential points of failure in the Double Spiral method, as one has to ensure that both spirals continue, not just that one spiral does. Therefore, the Single Spiral method can be used in place of the Double Spiral method.<p>The Modified Single Spiral method will work whenever the Single Spiral method does, as it is nearly the same, but with the inclusion of a possible alternative in case things go wrong. Therefore, the Modified Single Spiral method can be used in place of the Single Spiral method.<h1 class=unnumbered id=testing-the-modified-single-spiral-method-on-larger-cases>Testing the Modified Single Spiral Method on Larger Cases</h1><p>The Modified Single Spiral method worked on the three spherical fullerenes I looked at in part 1: C20 (the (1,0) fullerene), C60 (the (1,1) fullerene), and C80 (the (2,0) fullerene). However, as I only decided to test three spherical fullerenes (the <span class="inline math">\((m,n)\)</span> fullerenes with <span class="inline math">\(m + n \le 2\)</span>) I could not draw any conclusions.<h2 class=unnumbered id=c140-or-the-21-fullerene>C140 or the (2,1) fullerene</h2><div class=center><p><center><img src=/articles/research/Vol3_No1/spherical-part-2/C140.png alt=C140 style=width:45%;min-width:300px></center></div><p>The modified spiral method did not work in the (2,1) fullerene.<h2 class=unnumbered id=c180-or-the-30-fullerene>C180 or the (3,0) fullerene</h2><div class=center><p><center><img src=/articles/research/Vol3_No1/spherical-part-2/C180.png alt=C180 style=width:45%;min-width:300px> <img src=/articles/research/Vol3_No1/spherical-part-2/C180-spiral.png alt="C180 spiral"style=width:45%;min-width:300px></center></div><p>The modified spiral method worked in the (3,0) fullerene.<h2 class=unnumbered id=c240-or-the-22-fullerene>C240 or the (2,2) fullerene</h2><div class=center><p><center><img src=/articles/research/Vol3_No1/spherical-part-2/C240.png alt=C240 style=width:45%;min-width:300px> <img src=/articles/research/Vol3_No1/spherical-part-2/C240-spiral.png alt="C240 spiral"style=width:45%;min-width:300px></center></div><p>The modified spiral method worked in the (2,2) fullerene.

I looked into the (2,1) fullerene and the (3,1) fullerene, the two that didnâ€™t work, to see what went wrong. It turned out that an assumption I made earlier was wrong. When I created the rings of polygons that were a distance <span class="inline math">\(d\)</span> away from some fixed pentagon, I assumed that no three polygons in a ring would share a vertex. However, as the images below show, that is not the case for the (2,1) fullerene and the (3,1) fullerene.<div class=center><p><center><img src=/articles/research/Vol3_No1/spherical-part-2/C140-2.png alt="C140 Rings"style=width:45%;min-width:300px> <img src=/articles/research/Vol3_No1/spherical-part-2/C260-2.png alt="C260 rings"style=width:45%;min-width:300px></center></div><p>I will try to prove that the modified single spiral method always works when no three polygons in a ring share a vertex (these are cases in which every polygon in a ring borders exactly two other polygons in that ring, which donâ€™t border each other).<h1 class=unnumbered id=showing-that-the-modified-single-spiral-method-actually-creates-a-hamiltongon>Showing that the Modified Single Spiral Method actually creates a Hamiltongon</h1><p>First, itâ€™s important to show that the Modified Single Spiral Method actually creates a hamiltongon. Otherwise, there would be no point in using it. Iâ€™ll show that it satisfies every property of a hamiltongon.<h2 class=unnumbered id=connectedness>Connectedness</h2><p>In the process of creating a hamiltongon through the modified single spiral method, a pentagon is added to the hamiltongon and then hexagons and pentagons that adjoin the edge are repeatedly added. No pentagon or hexagon will ever be added that is isolated from the rest. Therefore, in the final product, no pentagon or hexagon will be isolated from the rest.<h2 class=unnumbered id=no-looping-or-connectedness-of-the--hamiltongon>No Looping (or connectedness of the -hamiltongon)</h2><p>For a loop to appear in a hamiltongon through the single spiral method, a polygon would have to be added that would "complete the loop" by bordering two polygons.<p>When moving up a ring, this cannot occur because the polygon added must be clockwise of the most clockwise polygon in the +hamiltongon in the previous ring, or counterclockwise of the most counterclockwise +hamiltongon in the previous ring. This means it can only border one polygon in the +hamiltongon in the previous ring, so it canâ€™t complete a loop. When moving along a ring, this also cannot occur, because the instructions say to move along a ring until you would break a rule, so polygons would stop being added before this could happen. Therefore, this will not happen.<h2 class=unnumbered id=the-perimeter-must-go-through-every-vertex>The Perimeter Must Go Through Every Vertex</h2><p>As was shown in the first article, an equivalent statement is to say that no vertex is entirely outside or entirely inside the +hamiltongon.<p>Every vertex is between two rings, or bordering two rings. Otherwise, the vertex would be completely surrounded by polygons in a ring, which is illegal in the cases for which I am proving this.<p>Each vertex is surrounded by three faces. This means if we call the rings on either side of a vertex ring <span class="inline math">\(A\)</span> and ring <span class="inline math">\(B\)</span> (where ring <span class="inline math">\(A\)</span> is one closer to the origin pentagon than ring <span class="inline math">\(B\)</span>), there are <span class="inline math">\(a=1\)</span> or <span class="inline math">\(2\)</span> polygons surrounding it in ring <span class="inline math">\(A\)</span>, and <span class="inline math">\(b=3-a\)</span> (<span class="inline math">\(1\)</span> or <span class="inline math">\(2\)</span>) polygons surrounding it in ring <span class="inline math">\(B\)</span>. <span class="inline math">\(1\)</span> or <span class="inline math">\(2\)</span> of those polygons must be in the +hamiltongon.<p>Because of the way the modified single spiral method is constructed, there will be a section of ring <span class="inline math">\(A\)</span> where all of the polygons are in the +hamiltongon, and in the rest of ring <span class="inline math">\(A\)</span> all of the polygons are in the -hamiltongon. Similarly, there is a section of ring <span class="inline math">\(B\)</span> where all of the polygons are in the +hamiltongon, and in the rest of ring <span class="inline math">\(B\)</span> all of the polygons are in the -hamiltongon. The section in ring <span class="inline math">\(B\)</span> thatâ€™s in the +hamiltongon touches one polygon in the section of ring <span class="inline math">\(A\)</span> thatâ€™s in the +hamiltongon, and then moves opposite to the section of ring <span class="inline math">\(A\)</span> in the -hamiltongon until it ends one polygon before the end of that section (this is because it goes as far as possible while preventing a loop).<p>The section of ring <span class="inline math">\(A\)</span> in the +hamiltongon and the section of ring <span class="inline math">\(B\)</span> in the +hamiltongon are only connected by one pair of polygons. This means that the form a chain of polygons, where no two polygons not adjacent in the chain border each other. This means there is no vertex completely surrounded by the +hamiltongon, as that would require two polygons not adjacent in the chain in the +hamiltongon to border each other.<p>Since the section of ring <span class="inline math">\(B\)</span> in the +hamiltongon moves opposite to the section of ring <span class="inline math">\(A\)</span> in the -hamiltongon until one before the end, the section of ring <span class="inline math">\(A\)</span> in the -hamiltongon and the section of ring <span class="inline math">\(B\)</span> in the -hamiltongon are also only connected by one pair of polygons. This means they also form a chain of polygons in which no two polygons not adjacent in the chain border each other, which means no vertex can be completely surrounded by the -hamiltongon (or completely outside of the +hamiltongon).<h2 class=unnumbered id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>As the shape created by the modified single spiral method satisfies all the properties of a hamiltongon, it is a hamiltongon.<h1 class=unnumbered id=proof>Proof</h1><p>To show that a modified single spiral hamiltongon can always be created when no vertex is contained entirely within a ring, Iâ€™ll show that no step in the construction of the modified single spiral method fails, going through one step at a time.<ol><li><p>Start by choosing a pentagon on the spherical fullerene. Call it <span class="inline math">\(P\)</span>. Group the polygons in the figure into rings based on their distance from <span class="inline math">\(P\)</span>.<ul><li><p>The first step cannot fail, as a pentagon can always be chosen.</ul><li><p>Add <span class="inline math">\(P\)</span> to the +hamiltongon.<ul><li><p>The second step cannot fail, as a pentagon can always be added to the +hamiltongon.</ul><li><p>Add one of the polygons in ring <span class="inline math">\(1\)</span> to the +hamiltongon.<ul><li><p>The third step cannot fail, as an adjoining polygon can always be added to the hamiltongon</ul><li><p>There will be one or more polygons adjoining the polygon that was just added in ring <span class="inline math">\(2\)</span>. Add the one that is clockwise of the rest.<ul><li><p>The fourth step cannot fail. This polygon borders one pentagon in ring <span class="inline math">\(0\)</span> and two polygons in ring <span class="inline math">\(1\)</span>. Therefore, it borders at least two polygons in ring <span class="inline math">\(2\)</span>. This means there will be a polygon clockwise of the others, which can be added.</ul><li><p>Continue adding polygons in a clockwise direction in ring <span class="inline math">\(2\)</span> until adding one would break a rule.<ul><li><p>The fifth step cannot fail, as no vertex will be enclosed by it since no three polygons in a ring share a vertex, and the +hamiltongon wonâ€™t enclose some isolated piece of the -hamiltongon, because the addition of polygons stops when a rule would be broken.</ul><li><p>Add the polygon of the adjoining ones in the ring above that is clockwise of the rest and keep adding polygons clockwise of it until you would break a rule OR if that is not possible, add the polygon of the adjoining ones in the ring above that is counterclockwise of the rest and keep adding polygons counterclockwise of it until you would break a rule.<ul><li><p>The sixth step is a bit more complicated. This is because of the part where you must add an adjoining polygon in the ring above which is clockwise or counterclockwise of the rest (depending on direction). If there is only one such adjoining polygon, it will share a vertex with two of the polygons that have already been added to the +hamiltongon in the row below, therefore breaking a rule. This could be avoided if you can always add from either the polygon in the ring below that is clockwise of the rest, or the polygon in the ring below that is counterclockwise of the rest. The section of a ring thatâ€™s in the +hamiltongon is always exactly <span class="inline math">\(\frac{0}{5}\)</span>, <span class="inline math">\(\frac{1}{5}\)</span>, <span class="inline math">\(\frac{2}{5}\)</span>, <span class="inline math">\(\frac{3}{5}\)</span>, or <span class="inline math">\(\frac{4}{5}\)</span> of the polygons in that ring. This can be shown by induction. A spherical fullerene is symmetric across a <span class="inline math">\(72 \degree\)</span> rotation, which means the polygon at the clockwise end of the section of a ring <span class="inline math">\(A\)</span> (which Iâ€™ll call <span class="inline math">\(R\)</span>) in the +hamiltongon is equivalent to the polygon that is one counterclockwise of the polygon at the counterclockwise end of the section in ring <span class="inline math">\(A\)</span> in the +hamiltongon. This means for both directions to fail, the polygon at the counterclockwise end (which Iâ€™ll call <span class="inline math">\(P\)</span>) and the polygon counterclockwise of that (which Iâ€™ll call <span class="inline math">\(Q\)</span>) must only border one polygon in the ring above, which Iâ€™ll call ring <span class="inline math">\(B\)</span>. This polygon must then border four polygons in ring <span class="inline math">\(A\)</span>: the two polygons that only border one polygon in ring <span class="inline math">\(B\)</span>, as well as the polygons on either side of them. As it must border two polygons in ring <span class="inline math">\(B\)</span>, it borders no polygons in ring <span class="inline math">\(C\)</span>. This means the two polygons it borders in ring <span class="inline math">\(B\)</span> are adjacent to each other. However, that means those three polygons surround a vertex, so a vertex is entirely contained within ring <span class="inline math">\(B\)</span>. This is a contradiction. Therefore, <span class="inline math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="inline math">\(Q\)</span> cannot each border only one polygon in ring <span class="inline math">\(B\)</span>, which means polygons <span class="inline math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="inline math">\(R\)</span> cannot each border only one polygon in ring <span class="inline math">\(B\)</span> (as <span class="inline math">\(Q\)</span> and <span class="inline math">\(R\)</span> are equivalent). This means step <span class="inline math">\(6\)</span> is always possible.</ul><li><p>Repeat step <span class="inline math">\(6\)</span> until you are forced to stop. If this works, you should be forced to stop on the diametrically opposed pentagon to <span class="inline math">\(P\)</span> or one of the five polygons adjoining it, and you should have created two hamiltongons on the spherical fullerene.<ul><li><p>If step <span class="inline math">\(6\)</span> works in general, it should work repeatedly.</ul></ol><h1 class=unnumbered id=works-cited>Works Cited</h1><ol style=word-wrap:break-word><li><p>Dodecahedrane.
